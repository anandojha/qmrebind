    frequency_calculation: str
        The string is set to "True" if the user chooses

        CHELPG, Mulliken, and the Loewdin charge calculation
        methods.

    qm2_charge: int
        Charge of the QM2 (low) region. The user does not have
        to provide the charge of the QM region since it is
        calculated by ORCA itself. The user also does not
        have to provide the charge of the MM region since it is
        determined by the ORCA force field file.

    qm2_mult: int
        The multiplicity of the QM2 (low) region. The user does
        not have to provide the multiplicity of the QM region

        The Universal Solvation Model (SMD) method, an implicit
        solvation model an improvement over the Conductor-like
        Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM), since it uses the
        full solute electron density to compute the cavity-dispersion
